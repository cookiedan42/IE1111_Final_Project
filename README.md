A project done in Y1S1 for IE2111   
It's very rough, but I'm quite proud of it  
  
By pulling MRT cost data from an API, find the cost of travel between two stations  
Putting this cost data into a travel pattern model, we estimate the monthly cost of travel and compare this with the price of a monthly unlimited travel pass   
Finally, display this data as a map for easy visual comparison, users can find the closest MRT stop by segment and gain visual insights.
